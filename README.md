## Docker Installation

### Windows
- Follow step from [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/).

### Linux

- Follow steps from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Docker Labs (Super Lazy Developers)
- Click [Lab](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/#) to initialize

### Skaffold, Kubectl, and Minikube setup

Follow steps from [here](https://skaffold.dev/docs/quickstart/) for Skaffold, Kubectl, and Minikube

#### Minikube dashboard

Minikube dashboard provides a good UI to view and manage the kubernetes cluster. 

Execute the following command to start Minikube dashboard
```
minikube dashboard
```

You should get an output similar to
```
ðŸ¤”  Verifying dashboard health ...
ðŸš€  Launching proxy ...
ðŸ¤”  Verifying proxy health ...
ðŸŽ‰  Opening http://127.0.0.1:42553/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/ in your default browser...
ðŸ‘‰  http://127.0.0.1:42553/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/http:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/
```

### Kustomize setup
Install Kustomize as per the instructions from [here](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/kustomize/installation/binaries/). This will install Kustomize into the current working directory. You can move it to bin path to make it available globally.

```
sudo mv ./kustomize /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage
### Fibonacci API

Fibonacci API supports [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) builds with [JIB](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) gradle plugin to build and deploy images either on [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) or [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).

#### Local build

We need to setup env variables to point docker to minikube instead of default config. This is required because minikube uses its own docker environment for running containers.

Execute the following command to setup env variables for Minikube's docker
```bash
eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
```

Navigate to 'fibonacci-api' directory from terminal and run the following command to start Skaffold 'dev' mode.
```bash
skaffold dev -p ${profile} # check list of available profiles from 'skaffold.yaml'
```

If the setup is correct, you should see an output similar to the following
```
Starting deploy...
 - deployment.apps/fibonacci-api-deployment created
Waiting for deployments to stabilize...
 - deployment/fibonacci-api-deployment is ready.

```

The application is deployed in Minikube as a [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/p) and has one initial [replica](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)/instance of the service. A Horizontal Pod Autoscaler will scale upto 10 instances of the service based on cpu load. In order to access the application, a [service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) is required which redirects requests to [pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/). 'k8s-service.yaml' has the configuration for the service. Refer to [service types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types) for more details.

Execute the following command to access the service from your browser at [http//localhost:1337/fibonacci/ping](http:localhost:1337/fibonacci/ping)
```bash
kubectl port-forward service/fibonacci-api-service 1337:1337
```
You should see an output similar to the following
```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:1337 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:1337 -> 8080
```

### Prime Number API

Pull the image from Docker Hub using the following command
``` bash
docker pull nishikantpatil/prime-number-api:0.1
```

Verify the image using the following command 
``` bash
docker images
```
Spin up a container using the following command 
``` bash
docker run -dp host-port:8080 nishikantpatil/prime-number-api:0.1 
# replace 'host-port' with any unused port on the host machine
```

Verify the container state using the following command
```bash
docker ps
```
Fibonacci API will be available at
